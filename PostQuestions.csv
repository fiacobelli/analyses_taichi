I attempted to remain casual and conversational, but the agent seemed to be functioning on rails- as if it were just a linear series of advertisements, as if the answers had already been written out with no interaction from the user except for waiting for something to be entered.  There are some chat bots that have made progress, although none that I have found terribly convincing.  

I think with this system, if you‘re trying to get a response that involves making an impact on a person, I would recommend 2 things:

1) have the bot interact, and repeat back, something specific that was said (similar to the way the default skype bot does), and

2) have a human be available, when possible, to step in and either help correct early mistakes or provide a rating for the interaction, if the agent is supposed to be learning."
mr2auhdddn24ho1tdva6kdg8m7,4,5,3,4,4,1,"Overall, the chat was quick and there was no confusion between the computer and I. However, the conversation did feel like I was communicating with a robot. The level of expression in the questions seemed fabricated. "
nubfub54b20fu4vsqigi6o2fl7,3,5,2,3,2,0,"So the responses were very generic in nature. Also it seemed that the response did seem to care if my response were either negative or positive in nature. he chat should have gone into more specifics. When trying to convince someone of something you need to say why the idea is good and the thing you are trying to promote uses it. So saying Tai chi makes you stronger is vague. If you say instead tai chi makes you stronger through its array of movements that are body strength in nature. Such movements consists of moving the body in different directions of multiple poses. In general because the description was vague anyone would have no reason to choose tai chi over any other workout program, so it needs to be sold more "

ceprtq01ps0n5q92h8r74emid4,3,5,5,3,2,1,"I feel the chat should focus a tab bit more on the actual responses, not necessarily just consistently giving out information in relation to tai chi. For example when asking about exercising and tai chi, put more independent focus on each aspects, in terms of the responses given."

k1iq58nmlcqevum3rfpt87hov9,3,5,3,3,3,0,It felt that a lot of questions were asking the exact same thing with slightly different wordings. Any indecisive answers need a bit more persuasion and information in their  responses so that the becomes more interested.

It‘s evident that there is an algorithm detecting key words, and the program responds based on those key words. I‘m sure that the algorithm could be revamped to make it feel more intuitive. At this stage it feels very robotic and lifeless."

o3tkf89tefiavhuhj9sdbi684m,3,5,5,5,4,1,Sometimes I feel like the chat should give more positive feedback or shouldn‘t ask those questions at all. For example when the chat is asking me what I do in order to stay health It seems to just skip over what I typed and goes into the benefits of Tai Chi. Also having pictures or video‘s to illustrate the benefits or examples of poses would keep me more entertained.
